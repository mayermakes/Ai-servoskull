# Ai-servoskull
An Ai driven skull (it hates computers but likes humans)

As seen on element14presents

this is a continuation of my terminator skull prject from 2018 using a beaglebone Ai back then.
the 2025 verison uses a Raspberry pi 5 8GB, Ai hat+, RPi Ai camera (though only the Ai hat is at the moment activelly used for ai stuff)
a custom servo hat
neopixel compatible led ring.

The neopixel have to be driven via SPi with the pi5neo library to make them work!

code was done with the tedious writing doen with copilot, and a lot of debuggin on my part..Ai wont replace that part for now.

so what this is is pretty much a surveilance camera that can tell if a person or a laptop is in the room and examines it with couriosity.
i wanted to give it a voice as well but even tinyllama does not run fast enough for real time reactions.

maybe later.
the code is a mess so don´t judge me i had to gett this thing working in time.
